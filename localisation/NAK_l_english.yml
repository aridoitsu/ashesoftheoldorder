 #Events
 NAK.2.t:0 "Assess the Nation"
 NAK.2.d:0 "Born from the ashes of the dying confederacy, New Afrika was originally only an idea by a few radicals in the south. But as the harsh whip of the white man cracked closer and closer to the black man’s neck, the only reasonable action to take was to fight back. Back when there was a semblance of democracy in the confederacy, they took to the streets, only to be answered with gunfire. So they took up arms of their own, and began a gruelling 2 year long struggle for freedom. By December 17th 2017, the forces of the New Afrikan Freedom Front under Jesse Jackson controlled land from the Appalachian to the Atlantic. But the fight is far from over, no, it has only begun. "
 NAK.2.a:0 "For Freedom!"
 NAK.3.t:0 "Prepare for the Inevitable"
 NAK.3.d:0 "This uneasy peace cannot last for long, not when Confederate ships circle like sharks around our ports, blocking any trade from getting in, not when they oppress our countrymen NAKoss the border. But they are too weak to fight back against us now, and we are too weak to strike deeper into their hearts. So we must ready our arms, strengthen the barricades, and prepare ourselves for when that day comes."
 NAK.4.t:0 "Assess the Economy"
 NAK.4.d:0 "New Afrika subsides off of scraps of whatever economy existed in the area before. With little to no heavy industry to speak of, and heavily reliant on foreign aid from the AUF, New Afrika is in no shape for an all out war. Crippling homelessness, malnourishment, and lack of adequate healthcare sweep the nation. Its arms comes from garage workshops, where people haphazardly put together makeshift guns or bombs, and its heavy weaponry is scavenged from abandoned Confederate armories that they left behind during their evacuation. This must be remedied before we are ready for War. "
 NAK.4.a:0 "Noted."
 NAK.5.t:0 "Assess the Military"
 NAK.5.d:0 "New Afrika’s military is the natural progression of their Insurrectionary forces against the Confederacy. Most of its soldiers are veterans battle hardened from years of guerrilla warfare, ready to defend New Afrika no matter the cost. They know the land they will fight on, and are always one step ahead of the confederates. Due to its nature, the New Afrikan military is severely lacking in heavy weaponry, air support, and armor. If an invasion were to occur, the most optimal way would be to fight a 1776-esque guerrilla campaign against the Confederacy."
 NAK.6.t:0 "Assess the Poltiical Situation"
 NAK.6.d:0 "While New Afrika has put aside its differences to fight the invader, internal divisions still exist. Among the High Command, the Radical Socialists believe that the best way to deal with the Confederacy is through a quick, decisive strike to demoralize them and secure a peace deal at Birmingham with a gun pressed to Cotton’s head. The Liberal Faction, however, believes in the continuation of the guerilla campaign is the only way to fight back against the superior forces of the Confederacy, and make the war too costly for them to continue it, forcing a peace treaty. On the home front, racial tensions threaten to tear the young nation apart, as many whites feel uneasy about living in “New Afrika” and being ruled by mostly African Americans, It is vital to calm the entire country down, to ensure there is no white sympathy for the confederacy, or even worse, an insurrection from them."
 NAK.7.t:0 "Food for the Hungry"
 NAK.7.d:0 "Marvin had seen the devastation the 2008 Famine had brought. Children, starving in the street, hundreds of beggars, all desperate for food. That time was long gone of course, but its scars remained. Marvin had lost his brother in the famine, and pledged revenge against the government that had sat idly by, doing nothing while his countrymen starved. According to Officer Brownlee, he was too skinny to enlist, and there were plenty of able bodied men like him willing to die on the frontlines. So he accepted the assignment for civilian duty. The first man hobbled in, and he handed him a sandwich, as well as some propaganda material upper management had assigned him to give out. And then more and more people started streaming in, and Marvin felt an overwhelming feeling of satisfaction. People would go hungry no longer, and no one would have to share the fate of his brother."
 NAK.7.a:0 "A Step in the Right Direction"
 NAK.8.t:0 "Training"
 NAK.8.d:0 "Marquel had seen the brutality of the Confederacy firsthand. He felt helpless, and could only keep his head down, in a desperate attempt to survive. He wasn’t brave enough to join the resistance, not at the time at least. So when the Confederates pulled out, he felt a sense of freedom for once. No longer were there curfews, no longer was he afraid of being confronted and thrown in jail when going to the supermarket.No, he was finally free. But the threat of the Confederacy loomed above, and he felt a sense of duty, and enlisted. Rushed through the basics of how to use a gun, dig a trench, and throw a grenade, he was thrown in a uniform, and positioned at the border."
 NAK.9.t:0 "Raiding Confederate Armories"
 NAK.9.d:0 "Desperately in need for heavy weaponry, the New Afrika Military had taken the task of retrieving, reactivating, or looting abandoned Military bases. So far, they were mostly successful. The Confederacy had left behind many armories in their hurried evacuation of the area, leaving many military bases ripe for picking. Sadly, many other scavengers had taken upon themselves to obtain these weapons, making their way to the black market. Overall, the army was still able to grab some tanks and artillery, and the first wing of the New Afrikan Air Force was formed, with some brave souls stepping up as pilots"
 NAK.10.t:0 "The National Question"
 NAK.10.d:0 "The question had always loomed over the young nation of its status. New Afrika - Many whites did not like living in a country in North America named “afrika". To them, Afrika evoked images of poverty, warlordism, and chaos, far from the american dream. But to the black population, it meant freedom form tyranny once and for all. It must be decided, whether we are to declare ourselves an autonomous region of the United States, and keep our American Identity, or separate, and become a new nation, and a new people."
 NAK.10.a:0 "Emancipation of the Black Man is Paramount!"
 NAK.10.b:0 "Compromises must be made"
 NAK.11.t:0 "Buying Foreign Arms"
 NAK.11.d:0 "The arms trade had always been a lucrative business, and the Great American Chaos was no different. Foreign nations sold guns to rebels, Local armories churned out guns to sell to the highest bidder. Our industry is crippled and in no shape to produce heavy weaponry, and our resources are limited which is why we must decide who we should get our equipment from. The Chinese, who have high quality tanks? The Russians, with their high end Artillery? The Europeans, for their planes? Or our neighbors the United Front, with their quality rifles?"
 NAK.11.a:0 "The Chinese"
 NAK.11.b:0 "The Russians"
 NAK.11.c:0 "The Europeans"
 NAK.11.e:0 "The Front"
